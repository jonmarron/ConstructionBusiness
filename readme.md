Construction business

A construction company wants to improve its internal practices by adopting a new digital system.

The first module of the application is employee management. An employee has a name, an employee id, as well as a position, either worker, supervisor, engineer or site manager.

Employees can be either salaried or part-time. Employees get their salaries in money (M) based on the following rules:

Workers get a base pay of 400M, and 6M per hour worked.

Supervisors get a base pay of 700M, 5M per hour plus 0.5M for each worker they supervise.

Engineers get a base pay of 700M, and 40M per hour.

Site managers get a base pay of 1000M, and 20M per hour.

Part-time employees do not get the base pay but get double the hourly rate of employed ones.

The next application module is managing the progress of construction sites. There are different types of construction sites: domestic houses, blocks of flats and office buildings. Each construction site has a list of employees responsible for it. Progress at a construction site only starts if one of the employees is a Site Manager.

Finally, for reporting, the company wants to know what is the average number of workers in an office building construction site.
